## Author parsing

Considering a metadata file, `authors` column is provided in `;`-delimited form.
When authors are parsed incorrectly, the following annomalies occur.

### Nonseparated authors

Some WHO papers have bad authors listings, unparsable.

https://search.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/en/ppcovidwho-2056

MITIGATION: Nothing could be done. These papers should be eliminated.

### Apostrophes

Apostrophes in cases of "O'Brian" are sometimes parsed incorrectly. 
Search for the string "039" in `authors` field.
Some problems are maybe related to use of backquote and other "single" quote chracters.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
